            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>XTC, also known as MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), is a synthetic drug valued for its ability
                to induce euphoria, energy, and empathy. It is commonly used recreationally, especially in the context
                of nightlife and festivals.
                The effects of XTC vary, but typically include increased energy, empathy, euphoria, heightened sensory
                perception, and a strong desire for interpersonal interaction and physical contact. The duration of the
                effects varies, with a peak usually occurring within 1-2 hours after ingestion and can last for 4-6
                hours.
                While XTC is considered less addictive than some other drugs, repeated or excessive use can lead to
                psychological dependence. Regular use can also be harmful to health, with potential side effects such as
                dehydration, overheating, teeth grinding, and increased heart rate. Additionally, there are concerns
                about the purity and composition of illegally obtained MDMA pills.
                The use of XTC is illegal in many countries and is classified as a controlled substance due to its
                potential for abuse and associated risks. Safety and responsible use are crucial when dealing with XTC
                or any form of drug use, and it is important to fully understand and consider the potential risks and
                effects before considering MDMA use.</p>
